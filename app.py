    Welcome to the USB-AI Mobility Team interactive booth for the SAE-AI mini-challenge.

    The objective of our entry was to develop a series of recommendations that would improve mobility accessibility, solving crucial social issues in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, based mainly on data analysis.

    With that objective in mind, and through the use of data mining tools and extensive research we found that a good solution to improve the mobility of the county citizens is to incentivize cycling among the county residents, through the development of cycling infrastructure.

    While looking through the data, we also found other useful insights that might be worth mentioning.

    In this application, we show the complete process that went into developing our solution and the different insight that we found in the data.

    We begin by analyzing the data looking for temporal patterns that show an increase or 
    decrease of accidents at certain times. Therefore, we grouped the data by year, month 
    and day of the week. For the first case, a sharp decrease in accidents can be observed 
    between the years 2019 and 2020, which can be easily attributed to the CoVID-19 
    pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures taken by the state government. 
    These measures drastically reduced the mobility of citizens and subsequently the 
    likelihood of accidents on the road. Fewer cars on the roads, fewer accidents are 
    likely to occur.

        Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a 
        way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar 
        (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). (Wikipedia)

        ### k-means clustering

        The KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of 
        equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster 
        sum-of-squares (see below). This algorithm requires the number of clusters to 
        be specified. It scales well to large number of samples and has been used across 
        a large range of application areas in many different fields. (Sklearn)

    Being the city of Pittsburgh seat of the Allegheny County, it‚Äôs interesting to study 
    the Bike(+) MasterPlan, which was published in June 2020 and 
    it is currently being implemented, one very importantcurrent project that has been 
    developed around alternatives means of transportation around the city. 
    It is important to notice that the program is not only limited to bikes, 
    the term is used to also includeother personal mobility devices such as electric
    pedal-assist bicycles, kick scooters or e-scooters, andanother similar lightweight 
    (less than 150 pounds), low-speed (less than 20 MPH) vehicles without 
    internalcombustion engines.

    Our proposal for protected intersections will focus, in an initial phase, on the two 
    sectors that contain the highest percentage of crashes that we want to avoid. The data
    analysis showed that the areas to be used would be:

    1. The East Allegheny, Strip District and Downtown Pittsburgh areas 
    2. Friendship, Bloomfield and Shadyside.


    Which respectively account for 8.5% and 8.2% of the intersection crashes involving the 
    county. The goal of this proposal is to focus the Bike(+) Plan to increase bicyclist 
    safety in at-risk areas.

    We also propose to implement electric bicycles as a means of delivery. The expansion 
    of bicycle infrastructure may lead to the introduction of new types of delivery 
    workers who perform their services using bicycles because, according to data analysis, 
    58% of delivery trips are 5 miles or less. This can be a benefit to the industry and 
    workers because it lowers the barrier to entry for a delivery job, as a car is no l
    onger required to complete customer orders. In addition, for delivery service workers, 
    profits would increase by 52% by using electric bikes instead of cars to make 
    deliveries. Because, although the number of daily deliveries would decrease, the costs 
    associated with fuel and regular vehicle maintenance decrease significantly and net 
    profit would increase. Therefore, the implementation of electric bicycles by delivery 
    companies would mean traffic benefits within the city, higher net profits for workers, 
    and a healthier lifestyle.

    ##  Traffic density

    With the objective of reducing traffic density, there should be noted that Mount 
    Lebanon, Beechview and the White Hall neighborhoods,located in the southern west part 
    of the city, have high traffic density during rush hour, and are not cover by the new bike 
    rental locations from the Bike(+) Plan, and so are important to be consider.

    ##  Obesity rates

    Our solution can positvely affect  the high 
    obesity rates found in Allegheny County being approximately  34%, 4% higher than the national 
    average.  That is why we took into account the obesity distribution (show in the figure below),
    to target areas with high obesity rates
    in the solution.  Particularly, the northwest part ofthe city reports obesity rates 
    that are considerably higher than the rest of the city.  This neighborhoods should be 
    taken into consideration for improving their health and quality of life.

    The implementation of the Bike (+) Plan could

    ## Traffic control systems
    
    Finally, we consider the implementation of traffic control using artificial 
    intelligence to monitor the status of traffic lights at intersections. These systems 
    can be based on computer vision for detection of road agents (cars, bicycles, 
    motorcycles, pedestrians, etc.) and the control algorithm employed can be based on 
    reinforcement learning or traditional control theory. Currently, this style of 
    solution is used to reduce intersection delay time at traffic signals, but it could 
    also allow for a safer way to control bicycle and pedestrian traffic. However, it is 
    very important to implement measures to ensure that the systems do not violate 
    people's privacy and that appropriate tests are performed on the systems to 
    corroborate their robustness to high-risk situations.
