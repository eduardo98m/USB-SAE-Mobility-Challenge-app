Welcome to the USB-SAE Mobility Team interactive both for the SAE-AI mini challenge.

The objective of our entry was to develop a series of recomendations that would improve mobility accessibility, 
solving crucial social issues in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, based mainly on data analisys.

With that objective in mind,  and trough the use of data mining tools and extensive research
we found that a good solution to imporve the mobility of the county citizens is to incetivice 
cycling among the county residents,
through the building of cycling infrastructure.

While looking trough the data, We also found other useful insights that might be worth mentioning.


In this application we show the tough process that went into developing our solution and the 
diferent insight that we found in the data.

    We begin by analyzing the data looking for temporal patterns that show an increase or 
    decrease of accidents at certain times. Therefore, we grouped the data by year, month 
    and day of the week. For the first case, a sharp decrease in accidents can be observed 
    between the years 2019 and 2020, which can be easily attributed to the CoVID-19 
    pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures taken by the state government. 
    These measures drastically reduced the mobility of citizens and subsequently the 
    likelihood of accidents on the road. Fewer cars on the roads, fewer accidents are 
    likely to occur.

    We also propose to implement electric bicycles as a means of delivery. The expansion 
    of bicycle infrastructure may lead to the introduction of new types of delivery 
    workers who perform their services using bicycles because, according to data analysis, 
    58% of delivery trips are 5 miles or less. This can be a benefit to the industry and 
    workers because it lowers the barrier to entry for a delivery job, as a car is no l
    onger required to complete customer orders. In addition, for delivery service workers, 
    profits would increase by 52% by using electric bikes instead of cars to make 
    deliveries. Because, although the number of daily deliveries would decrease, the costs 
    associated with fuel and regular vehicle maintenance decrease significantly and net 
    profit would increase. Therefore, the implementation of electric bicycles by delivery 
    companies would mean traffic benefits within the city, higher net profits for workers,

    Finally, we consider the implementation of traffic control using artificial 
    intelligence to monitor the status of traffic lights at intersections. These systems 
    can be based on computer vision for detection of road agents (cars, bicycles, 
    motorcycles, pedestrians, etc.) and the control algorithm employed can be based on 
    reinforcement learning or traditional control theory. Currently, this style of 
    solution is used to reduce intersection delay time at traffic signals, but it could 
    also allow for a safer way to control bicycle and pedestrian traffic. However, it is 
    very important to implement measures to ensure that the systems do not violate 
    people's privacy and that appropriate tests are performed on the systems to 
    corroborate their robustness to high-risk situations.
