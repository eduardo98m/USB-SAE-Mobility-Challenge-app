    Welcome to the USB-AI Mobility Team interactive booth for the SAE-AI mini-challenge.

    The objective of our entry was to develop a series of recommendations that would improve mobility accessibility, solving crucial social issues in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, based mainly on data analysis.

    With that objective in mind, and through the use of data mining tools and extensive research we found that a good solution to improve the mobility of the county citizens is to incentivize cycling among the county residents, through the development of cycling infrastructure.

    While looking through the data, we also found other useful insights that might be worth mentioning.

    In this application, we show the complete process that went into developing our solution and the different insight that we found in the data.

    We begin by analyzing the data looking for temporal patterns that show an increase or 
    decrease of accidents at certain times. Therefore, we grouped the data by year, month, 
    and day of the week. For the first case, a sharp decrease in accidents can be observed 
    between the years 2019 and 2020, which can be easily attributed to the CoVID-19 
    pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures taken by the state government. 
    These measures drastically reduced the mobility of citizens and subsequently the 
    likelihood of accidents on the road. Fewer cars on the roads, fewer accidents are 
    likely to occur.

    Lastly, we noticed that the number of accidents that occurred on roads with 25 mph

    explained by two factors: that most roads have a 25 mph speed limit; but also that 
    such a limit may not be appropriate for some of the roads where it is imposed, i.e., 
    reducing the speed limit to 20 mph by introducing some traffic calming measures may

        Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a 
        way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar 
        (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). (Wikipedia)

        ### k-means clustering

        The KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of 
        equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster 
        sum-of-squares (see below). This algorithm requires the number of clusters to be 
        specified. It scales well to a large number of samples and has been used across a

    # Conclusions
    
    In this case, the data shows that regular intersections are a serious problem for all 
    traffic actors (cyclists and drivers). The safety risk that they pose is so great that 
    a significant proportion of all traffic accidents occur near them, and it extends to 
    almost 70% in the case of bicycle-related accidents. They, in turn, inhibit people 
    from cycling and make driving a more significant safety risk.

    ## Protected Intersections
    A proven measure to prevent and reduce these kinds of accidents is protected 
    intersections. These are a special type of intersection where the cyclist and 
    pedestrians are separated from cars by a buffer zone, and drivers gain wider 
    visibility, increasing their reaction time.

    Allegheny County happened in intersections.In order for people to start investing in 
    bicycle mobility, it is necessary that safety issues like these are addressed. Some 
    solutions have been proposed to solve this type of problem. A study made by the 
    Directory of Danish Roads [6] worked around 10 road applicable solutions for bicycle

    Another solution that is proposed by the Directory of Danish Roads [6] is the 
    development of a regularterminated cycle lane next to a separate right-turn lane for 
    vehicles.  These types of structures give the cyclers a greater sense of security as 
    they have their own space before entering the intersection. Also,forcing the car 
    lane for only right-turn decreases the number of accidents between bikes and cars by
    about 50% if previously the lane allowed for right-turn and straight-away passage. But 
    still, there arefar more impactful solutions that can improve safety for cyclers 
    in intersections. In San Francisco, aprotected intersection design resulted in 98% of 
    drivers yielding to people on bikes, and 100% yield topeople walking [7], and a study 
    in New York found that protected intersections had fewer vehicle-bikeconflicts than 
    even a dedicated turn lane with a dedicated bike signal phase [7]. The infrastructure 
    has to have the bicycle user in mind during its design. Roads are meant for cars, new
